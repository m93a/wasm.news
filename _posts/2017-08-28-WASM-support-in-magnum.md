excerpt: The Open Source C++11/C++14 and OpenGL graphics engine Magnum recently added first-class WebAssembly support. An article on the official blog explains how to easily compile your C++ projects to WebAssembly, compares it to asm.js and mentions a few useful tips for best online experience. Last but not least, there's a bunch of online demos that use both WebGL 1 and 2, showing how a single codebase can be run both natively and in the browser.
